\S{psftp-manpage-name} NAME

\cw{psftp} \- interactive SFTP (secure file transfer protocol) client

\S{psftp-manpage-synopsis} SYNOPSIS

\c psftp [options] [user@]host
\e bbbbb  iiiiiii   iiiib iiii

\S{psftp-manpage-description} DESCRIPTION

\cw{psftp} is an interactive text-based client for the SSH-based SFTP
(secure file transfer) protocol.

\S{psftp-manpage-options} OPTIONS

The command-line options supported by \cw{psftp} are:

\dt \cw{-V}

\dd Show version information and exit.

\dt \cw{-pgpfp}

\dd Display the fingerprints of the PuTTY PGP Master Keys and exit,
to aid in verifying new files released by the PuTTY team.

\dt \cw{-b} \e{batchfile}

\dd Use specified batchfile.

\dt \cw{-bc}

\dd Output batchfile commands.

\dt \cw{-be}

\dd Don't stop batchfile processing on errors.

\dt \cw{-v}

\dd Show verbose messages.

\dt \cw{-load} \e{session}

\dd Load settings from saved session.

\dt \cw{-P} \e{port}

\dd Connect to port \e{port}.

\dt \cw{\-proxycmd} \e{command}

\dd Instead of making a TCP connection, use \e{command} as a proxy;
network traffic will be redirected to the standard input and output
of \e{command}. \e{command} must be a single word, so is likely to
need quoting by the shell.

\lcont{
The special strings \cw{%host} and \cw{%port} in \e{command} will be
replaced by the hostname and port number you want to connect to; to get
a literal \c{%} sign, enter \c{%%}.

Backslash escapes are also supported, such as sequences like \c{\\n}
being replaced by a literal newline; to get a literal backslash,
enter \c{\\\\}. (Further escaping may be required by the shell.)

(See the main PuTTY manual for full details of the supported \cw{%}-
and backslash-delimited tokens, although most of them are probably not
very useful in this context.)
}

\dt \cw{-l} \e{user}

\dd Set remote username to \e{user}.

\dt \cw{-batch}

\dd Disable interactive prompts.

\dt \cw{-no-sanitise-stderr}

\dd By default, PSFTP will filter control characters from the standard error
channel from the server, to prevent remote processes sending confusing
escape sequences. This option forces the standard error channel to not be
filtered.

\dt \cw{-pwfile} \e{filename}

\dd Open the specified file, and use the first line of text read from
it as the remote password.

\dt \cw{-pw} \e{password}

\dd Set remote password to \e{password}. \e{CAUTION:} this will likely
make the password visible to other users of the local machine (via
commands such as \q{\c{ps}} or \q{\c{w}}). Use \cw{-pwfile} instead.

\dt \cw{-1}

\dd Force use of SSH protocol version 1.

\dt \cw{-2}

\dd Force use of SSH protocol version 2.

\dt \cw{-ssh-connection}

\dd Force use of the \q{bare \cw{ssh-connection}} protocol. This is
only likely to be useful when connecting to a \cw{psusan}(\e{1})
server, most likely with an absolute path to a Unix-domain socket in
place of \e{host}.

\dt \cw{-ssh}

\dd Force use of the SSH protocol. (This is usually not needed; it's
only likely to be useful if you need to override some other
configuration of the \q{bare \cw{ssh-connection}} protocol.)

\dt \cw{-4}, \cw{-6}

\dd Force use of IPv4 or IPv6 for network connections.

\dt \cw{-C}

\dd Enable SSH compression.

\dt \cw{-i} \e{keyfile}

\dd Private key file for user authentication. For SSH-2 keys, this key
file must be in PuTTY's PPK format, not OpenSSH's format or anyone
else's.

\lcont{ If you are using an authentication agent, you can also specify
a \e{public} key here (in RFC 4716 or OpenSSH format), to identify
which of the agent's keys to use. }

\dt \cw{\-noagent}

\dd Don't try to use an authentication agent.

\dt \cw{\-agent}

\dd Allow use of an authentication agent. (This option is only necessary
to override a setting in a saved session.)

\dt \cw{\-no\-trivial\-auth}

\dd Disconnect from any SSH server which accepts authentication without
ever having asked for any kind of password or signature or token. (You
might want to enable this for a server you always expect to challenge
you, for instance to ensure you don't accidentally type your key file's
passphrase into a compromised server spoofing PSFTP's passphrase
prompt.)

\dt \cw{\-hostkey} \e{key}

\dd Specify an acceptable host public key. This option may be specified
multiple times; each key can be either a fingerprint (\cw{SHA256:AbCdE...},
\cw{99:aa:bb:...}, etc) or a base64-encoded blob in OpenSSH's one-line
format.

\lcont{ Specifying this option overrides automated host key
management; \e{only} the key(s) specified on the command-line will be
accepted (unless a saved session also overrides host keys, in which
case those will be added to), and the host key cache will not be
written. }

\dt \cw{\-sshlog} \e{logfile}

\dt \cw{\-sshrawlog} \e{logfile}

\dd These options make \cw{psftp} log protocol details to a file.
(Some of these may be sensitive, although by default an effort is made
to suppress obvious passwords.)

\lcont{
\cw{\-sshlog} logs decoded SSH packets and other events (those that
\cw{\-v} would print). \cw{\-sshrawlog} additionally logs the raw
encrypted packet data.
}

\dt \cw{\-logoverwrite}

\dd If PSFTP is configured to write to a log file that already exists,
discard the existing file.

\dt \cw{\-logappend}

\dd If PSFTP is configured to write to a log file that already exists,
append new log data to the existing file.
