 * gtkapp.c: a top-level front end to GUI PuTTY and pterm, using
 * GtkApplication. Suitable for OS X. Currently unfinished.
 *
 * (You could run it on ordinary Linux GTK too, in principle, but I
 * don't think it would be particularly useful to do so, even once
 * it's fully working.)
 */

/*

To build on OS X, you will need a build environment with GTK 3 and
gtk-mac-bundler, and also Halibut on the path (to build the man pages,
without which the standard Makefile will complain). Then, from a clean
checkout, do this:

./mkfiles.pl -U --with-quartz
make -C icons icns
make -C doc
make

and you should get unix/PuTTY.app and unix/PTerm.app as output.

TODO list for a sensible GTK3 PuTTY/pterm on OS X:

Still to do on the application menu bar: items that have to vary with
context or user action (saved sessions and mid-session special
commands), and disabling/enabling the main actions in parallel with
their counterparts in the Ctrl-rightclick context menu.

Mouse wheel events and trackpad scrolling gestures don't work quite
right in the terminal drawing area. This seems to be a combination of
two things, neither of which I completely understand yet. Firstly, on
OS X GTK my trackpad seems to generate GDK scroll events for which
gdk_event_get_scroll_deltas returns integers rather than integer
multiples of 1/30, so we end up scrolling by very large amounts;
secondly, the window doesn't seem to receive a GTK "draw" event until
after the entire scroll gesture is complete, which means we don't get
constant visual feedback on how much we're scrolling by.

There doesn't seem to be a resize handle on terminal windows. Then
again, they do seem to _be_ resizable; the handle just isn't shown.
Perhaps that's a feature (certainly in a scrollbarless configuration
the handle gets in the way of the bottom right character cell in the
terminal itself), but it would be nice to at least understand _why_ it
happens and perhaps include an option to put it back again.

A slight oddity with menus that pop up directly under the mouse
pointer: mousing over the menu items doesn't highlight them initially,
but if I mouse off the menu and back on (without un-popping-it-up)
then suddenly that does work. I don't know if this is something I can
fix, though; it might very well be a quirk of the underlying GTK.

Does OS X have a standard system of online help that I could tie into?

Need to work out what if anything we can do with Pageant on OS X.
Perhaps it's too much bother and we should just talk to the
system-provided SSH agent? Or perhaps not.

Nice-to-have: a custom right-click menu from the application's dock
tile, listing the saved sessions for quick launch. As far as I know
there's nothing built in to GtkApplication that can produce this, but
it's possible we might be able to drop a piece of native Cocoa code in
under ifdef, substituting an application delegate of our own which
forwards all methods we're not interested in to the GTK-provided one?

At the point where this becomes polished enough to publish pre-built,
I suppose I'll have to look into OS X code signing.
https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GTK%2B/OSX/Bundling has some links.
