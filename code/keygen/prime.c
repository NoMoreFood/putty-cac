     * Estimating the cost of making a _provable_ prime is difficult
     * because of all the recursions to smaller sizes.
     *
     * Once you have enough factors of p-1 to certify primality of p,
     * the remaining work in provable prime generation is not very
     * different from probabilistic: you generate a random candidate,
     * test its primality probabilistically, and use the witness value
     * generated as a byproduct of that test for the full Pocklington
     * verification. The expensive part, as usual, is made of modpows.
     *
     * The Pocklington test needs at least two modpows (one for the
     * Fermat check, and one per known factor of p-1).
     *
     * The prior M-R step needs an unknown number, because we iterate
     * until we find a value whose order is divisible by the largest
     * power of 2 that divides p-1, say 2^j. That excludes half the
     * possible witness values (specifically, the quadratic residues),
     * so we expect to need on average two M-R operations to find one.
     * But that's only if the number _is_ prime - as usual, it's also
     * possible that we hit a non-prime and have to try again.
     *
     * So, if we were only estimating the cost of that final step, it
     * would look a lot like the probabilistic version: we'd have to
     * estimate the expected total number of modexps by knowing
     * something about the density of primes among our candidate
     * integers, and then multiply that by estimate_modexp_cost(bits).
     * But the problem is that we also have to _find_ a smaller prime,
     * so we have to recurse.
     *
     * In the MAURER_SIMPLE version of the algorithm, you recurse to
     * any one of a range of possible smaller sizes i, each with
     * probability proportional to 1/i. So your expected time to
     * generate an n-bit prime is given by a horrible recurrence of
     * the form E_n = S_n + (sum E_i/i) / (sum 1/i), in which S_n is
     * the expected cost of the final step once you have your smaller
     * primes, and both sums are over ceil(n/2) <= i <= n-20.
     *
     * At this point I ran out of effort to actually do the maths
     * rigorously, so instead I did the empirical experiment of
     * generating that sequence in Python and plotting it on a graph.
     * My Python code is here, in case I need it again:

from math import log

alpha = log(3)/log(2) + 1 # exponent for modexp using Karatsuba mult

E = [1] * 16 # assume generating tiny primes is trivial

for n in range(len(E), 4096):

    # Expected time for sub-generations, as a weighted mean of prior
    # values of the same sequence.
    lo = (n+1)//2
    hi = n-20
    if lo <= hi:
        subrange = range(lo, hi+1)
        num = sum(E[i]/i for i in subrange)
        den = sum(1/i for i in subrange)
    else:
        num, den = 0, 1

    # Constant term (cost of final step).
    # Similar to probprime_add_progress_phase.
    winnow_factor = 1 if n < 32 else 19.76
    prob = winnow_factor / (n * log(2))
    cost = 4 * n**alpha / prob

    E.append(cost + num / den)

for i, p in enumerate(E):
    try:
        print(log(i), log(p))
    except ValueError:
        continue

     * The output loop prints the logs of both i and E_i, so that when
     * I plot the resulting data file in gnuplot I get a log-log
     * diagram. That showed me some early noise and then a very
     * straight-looking line; feeding the straight part of the graph
     * to linear-regression analysis reported that it fits the line
     *
     *     log E_n = -1.7901825337965498 + 3.6199197179662517 * log(n)
     * =>      E_n = 0.16692969657466802 * n^3.6199197179662517
     *
     * So my somewhat empirical estimate is that Maurer prime
     * generation costs about 0.167 * bits^3.62, in the same arbitrary
     * time units used by estimate_modexp_cost.
