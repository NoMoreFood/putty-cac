 * length and be composed of filename-legal characters.
 *
 * Rationale: Windows's named pipes all live in the same namespace, so
 * one user can see what pipes another user has open. This is an
 * undesirable privacy leak: in particular, if we used unobfuscated
 * names for the connection-sharing pipe names, it would permit one
 * user to know what username@host another user is SSHing to.
 *
 * The returned string is dynamically allocated.
